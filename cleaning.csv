135,NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center,NY,None,6800,Theft,Network Server,2014-06-19,"Data breach results in $4.8 million HIPAA settlements

Two health care organizations have agreed to settle charges that they potentially violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules by failing to secure thousands of patients' electronic protected health information (ePHI) held on their network. The monetary payments of $4,800,000 include the largest HIPAA settlement to date.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) initiated its investigation of New York and Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) and Columbia University (CU) following their submission of a joint breach report, dated September 27, 2010, regarding the disclosure of the ePHI of 6,800 individuals, including patient status, vital signs, medications, and laboratory results. 

NYP and CU are separate covered entities that participate in a joint arrangement in which CU faculty members serve as attending physicians at NYP. The entities generally refer to their affiliation as 'New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.'  NYP and CU operate a shared data network and a shared network firewall that is administered by employees of both entities. The shared network links to NYP patient information systems containing ePHI.

The investigation revealed that the breach was caused when a physician employed by CU who developed applications for both NYP and CU attempted to deactivate a personally-owned computer server on the network containing NYP patient ePHI. Because of a lack of technical safeguards, deactivation of the server resulted in ePHI being accessible on internet search engines. The entities learned of the breach after receiving a complaint by an individual who found the ePHI of the individual's deceased partner, a former patient of NYP, on the internet.

In addition to the impermissible disclosure of ePHI on the internet, OCR's investigation found that neither NYP nor CU made efforts prior to the breach to assure that the server was secure and that it contained appropriate software protections. Moreover, OCR determined that neither entity had conducted an accurate and thorough risk analysis that identified all systems that access NYP ePHI. As a result, neither entity had developed an adequate risk management plan that addressed the potential threats and hazards to the security of ePHI. Lastly, NYP failed to implement appropriate policies and procedures for authorizing access to its databases and failed to comply with its own policies on information access management.

'When entities participate in joint compliance arrangements, they share the burden of addressing the risks to protected health information,'  said Christina Heide, Acting Deputy Director of Health Information Privacy for OCR. 'Our cases against NYP and CU should remind health care organizations of the need to make data security central to how they manage their information systems.' 

NYP has paid OCR a monetary settlement of $3,300,000 and CU $1,500,000, with both entities agreeing to a substantive corrective action plan, which includes undertaking a risk analysis, developing a risk management plan, revising policies and procedures, training staff, and providing progress reports.

OCR opened an investigation of the covered entity (CE), Paul G. Klein DPM, after it reported an encrypted and password protected laptop was stolen that contained the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of 2,500 individuals.  The ePHI included names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, diagnosis conditions, lab test results, medications, medical notes, and treatment plans.  Upon discovery of the breach, the CE filed a police report to recover the stolen item.  As a result of OCR's investigation, the CE provided confirmation that there was encryption software and multi-layered password protection software installed on the stolen laptop.  OCR determined that the impermissible disclosure of ePHI did not constitute a breach under the Privacy Rule's breach notification rule and provided technical assistance to the CE regarding the requirements of the breach notification rule.

Pershing VA Medical Center, after the CE reported that its business associate (BA), Stress Laboratory, placed a box of unsecured protected health information (PHI) in an equipment storage room.  The PHI included the names, social security numbers, diagnoses, and age of approximately 589 individuals.  This breach incident involved a BA, and occurred prior to the September 23, 2013 compliance date.  The BA employee involved in this matter separated from employment in 2012, and the BA was reorganized and has been incorporated into the CE.  The CE provided breach notification to affected individuals, HHS, and the media.  Substitute notification was provided through a posting on the CE's main website with a toll-free information number.  The CE also offered one year of identity protection and credit monitoring services to affected individuals.  As a result of this incident, the CE adopted a new policy that provides guidance to its staff regarding the handling of PHI.  Additionally, the CE trained its employees on this new policy, and re-trained its employees on the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules.  Finally, OCR obtained assurances that the CE implemented the corrective action listed above.
